    "# 1. Describe the structure of an artificial neuron. How is it similar to a biological neuron? What are its main components?\n",

    "# Ans:\n",
    "# An artificial neuron consists of three main components: inputs, weights, and an activation function. Inputs are numerical values \n",
    "# representing the information received by the neuron. Each input is multiplied by a corresponding weight, which determines the \n",
    "# importance of that input. These weighted inputs are then summed up. The activation function applies a non-linear transformation to \n",
    "# the sum of the weighted inputs, producing the neuron's output.\n",

    "# The structure of an artificial neuron is inspired by the biological neuron, as it mimics the fundamental elements of a biological neuron. \n",
